### Spreadsheet scripts ###
This project includes some examples of how to use Google Sheets to
 * Visualize data on a dashboard
 * View recent changes by recoloring cells of the sheet


#### background_colors.js ####

    This script assumes you are not using Notes (comments) in any of your cells
    in your spreadsheet.  DO NOTE USE THIS SCRIPT if you rely on your own Notes.

    To use this script, click on Tools -> Script Editor in your Sheet and paste
    in the contents of this file.

    Reopen your sheet, and make an edit. A couple seconds after editing, you
    should notice the background color of the cell you edited turn green.

    Reopen it again, and notice all cells will change color based on when they
    were last edited.



#### /dashboard ####

    The dashboard assumes you are running it on a web server (start a local
    web server if needed).

    The only configuration required is to modify dashboard.js with the key of
    your spreadsheet.
